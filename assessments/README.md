# Assessment System - Classical Machine Learning

> **"Assessment is not about measuring what you know, but about understanding how you think."**

## Assessment Overview

This comprehensive assessment system evaluates your understanding of classical machine learning concepts through multiple formats and difficulty levels.

## Assessment Types



### **1. Knowledge Quizzes** (20% of grade)

### **2. Coding Challenges** (30% of grade)
- **Format**: Implement algorithms from scratch
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours per challenge
- **Frequency**: 2 per phase
- **Purpose**: Test practical implementation skills

### **3. Project Portfolio** (25% of grade)
- **Format**: End-to-end ML projects
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks per project
- **Frequency**: 1 per phase
- **Purpose**: Test real-world application skills

### **4. Peer Review** (15% of grade)
- **Format**: Review and provide feedback on others' work
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours per review
- **Frequency**: 3 times throughout course
- **Purpose**: Develop critical thinking and communication

### **5. Final Examination** (10% of grade)
- **Format**: Comprehensive written exam
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Frequency**: End of course
