# Emai Conference Practicals 2025: Classical Machine Learning; 

> **"The best way to learn machine learning is to understand the mathematics behind it, then implement it, and finally apply it to real problems."**

## Overview

These tutorials has been created intentional for participants of Emai Conference in 2025. It guides and provides a begginer level and practical learning experience that takes you from mathematical foundations, classical machine learning to real-world applications.

## What is Classical Machine Learning?

Classical machine learning refers to traditional algorithms and techniques that form the foundation of modern AI. Unlike deep learning, which relies on neural networks with many layers, classical ML uses mathematical and statistical methods to learn patterns from data.

- **Fast**: Quick to train and make predictions
- **Reliable**: Well-established theoretical foundations

### Real-World Applications:

**Healthcare & Medicine**
- Disease diagnosis and prognosis
- Drug discovery and development
- Medical image analysis
- Treatment recommendation systems

**Finance & Banking**
- Credit scoring and risk assessment
- Fraud detection and prevention
- Algorithmic trading strategies
- Insurance underwriting

**Business & E-commerce**
- Customer segmentation and targeting
- Recommendation systems
- Sales forecasting
- Supply chain optimization

**Technology & Engineering**
- Spam detection and email filtering
- Search engine optimization
- Quality control in manufacturing
- Predictive maintenance

**Science & Research**
- Climate modeling and weather prediction
- Genomic analysis and bioinformatics
- Materials science and discovery
- Social network analysis

### Why Learn Classical ML?

1. **Foundation for Advanced AI**: Understanding classical ML is essential before diving into deep learning
