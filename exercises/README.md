## Exercise Difficulty Levels

- **Beginner**: Basic concepts and simple implementations
- **Intermediate**: More complex problems requiring deeper understanding
- **Advanced**: Challenging problems that integrate multiple concepts
- **Expert**: Research-level problems and open-ended challenges

## How to Use These Exercises

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Complete mathematical foundation exercises
2. **Follow the sequence** - Each phase builds upon the previous
3. **Choose your level** - Start with beginner, progress to advanced
4. **Read the theory** - Understand concepts before coding
5. **Experiment freely** - Try different approaches and parameters
6. **Document your work** - Keep notes on what you learn

## Exercise Completion Tracking

- **Phase 1**: 0/12 exercises completed
- **Phase 2**: 0/15 exercises completed
- **Phase 3**: 0/12 exercises completed
- **Phase 4**: 0/10 exercises completed
- **Phase 5**: 0/8 exercises completed

**Total Progress**: 0/57 exercises completed (0%)

## Exercise Format

Each exercise includes:
- **Learning Objectives**: What you'll achieve
- **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the task
- **Background Theory**: Relevant concepts to review
- **Implementation Hints**: Tips for getting started
- **Expected Output**: What your solution should produce
- **Extension Challenges**: Additional problems to try
- **Solution Discussion**: Key insights and takeaways

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. **Choose an exercise** from your current phase
3. **Read the problem statement** carefully
4. **Review the background theory** if needed
5. **Implement your solution** step by step
6. **Test your solution** with provided examples
