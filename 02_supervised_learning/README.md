## 1. Introduction to Supervised Learning

### 1.1 What is Supervised Learning?
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where we learn a mapping from inputs to outputs using labeled training data.

**Key Components:**
- **Input (X)**: Features or independent variables
- **Output (y)**: Target or dependent variable
- **Training Data**: Pairs of (input, output) examples
- **Model**: Function that maps inputs to outputs
- **Learning**: Process of finding the best mapping

### 1.2 Types of Supervised Learning

#### Regression
- **Goal**: Predict continuous numerical values
- **Examples**: House prices, stock prices, temperature
- **Output**: Real numbers

#### Classification
- **Goal**: Predict discrete categories or classes
- **Examples**: Spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis
- **Output**: Categories or probabilities

### 1.3 The Learning Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather labeled training examples
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithm
4. **Training**: Learn parameters from training data
5. **Validation**: Test on unseen data
6. **Deployment**: Use model for predictions

## 2. Regression Algorithms

### 2.1 Linear Regression
The simplest and most fundamental regression algorithm.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- **Model**: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon$
- **Goal**: Find $\beta$ values that minimize prediction error
- **Method**: Least squares optimization

**Key Concepts:**
- **Bias term** ($\beta_0$): Intercept of the line
- **Coefficients** ($\beta_1, \beta_2, ...$): Slopes for each feature
- **Residuals**: Differences between predicted and actual values
- **R-squared**: Proportion of variance explained

### 2.2 Polynomial Regression
Extends linear regression to capture non-linear relationships.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- **Model**: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + ... + \beta_d x^d + \epsilon$
- **Degree**: Controls the complexity of the curve
- **Trade-off**: Higher degree = more flexible but risk of overfitting

### 2.3 Regularized Regression

#### Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
- **Penalty**: Sum of squared coefficients
- **Effect**: Shrinks coefficients toward zero
- **Use case**: When features are correlated

#### Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
- **Penalty**: Sum of absolute coefficients
- **Effect**: Can set coefficients to exactly zero
- **Use case**: Feature selection and sparse models

#### Elastic Net
- **Combination**: Both L1 and L2 penalties
- **Balance**: Between Ridge and Lasso benefits

## 3. Classification Algorithms

### 3.2 Naive Bayes
Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- **Bayes' Theorem**: $P(y|x) = \frac{P(x|y)P(y)}{P(x)}$

- **Types**: Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli

**Key Concepts:**
- **Prior Probability**: $P(y)$ - probability of each class
- **Likelihood**: $P(x|y)$ - probability of features given class
- **Posterior**: $P(y|x)$ - probability of class given features

### 3.3 Decision Trees
Tree-based model that makes decisions by asking questions about features.

**Key Concepts:**
