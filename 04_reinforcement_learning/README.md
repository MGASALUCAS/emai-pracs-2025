## 1. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

### 1.1 What is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

**Key Components:**
- **Agent**: The learner or decision maker
- **Environment**: The world in which the agent operates
- **State**: Current situation of the agent
- **Action**: What the agent can do
- **Reward**: Feedback from the environment
- **Policy**: Strategy for choosing actions

### 1.2 The RL Learning Loop

1. **Observe**: Agent observes current state
2. **Act**: Agent chooses an action based on policy
3. **Feedback**: Environment provides reward and next state
4. **Learn**: Agent updates its policy based on experience
5. **Repeat**: Process continues until learning is complete

### 1.3 Types of Reinforcement Learning

#### Model-Based vs Model-Free
- **Model-Based**: Agent learns a model of the environment
- **Model-Free**: Agent learns directly from experience

#### On-Policy vs Off-Policy
- **On-Policy**: Learn about the policy being followed
- **Off-Policy**: Learn about a different policy

#### Value-Based vs Policy-Based
- **Value-Based**: Learn value functions, derive policy
- **Policy-Based**: Learn policy directly
- **Actor-Critic**: Combine both approaches

## 2. Markov Decision Processes

### 2.1 MDP Components
A Markov Decision Process is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making.

**Components:**
- **States (S)**: Set of possible situations
- **Actions (A)**: Set of possible actions
- **Transition Probabilities (P)**: P(s'|s,a) - probability of next state
- **Rewards (R)**: R(s,a,s') - reward for taking action a in state s
- **Discount Factor (γ)**: How much future rewards matter

### 2.2 Markov Property
The future depends only on the current state, not the history.

**Mathematical Definition:**
P(S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = s, A_t = a, S_{t-1}, ..., S_0) = P(S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = s, A_t = a)

### 2.3 Policy
A policy π(a|s) defines the probability of taking action a in state s.

**Types:**
- **Deterministic**: Always choose the same action
- **Stochastic**: Choose actions with certain probabilities
- **Optimal**: Maximizes expected cumulative reward

## 3. Value-Based Methods

### 3.1 Value Functions
Value functions estimate how good it is to be in a state or take an action.

**State Value Function V^π(s):**
- Expected cumulative reward from state s following policy π
- V^π(s) = E[G_t | S_t = s] where G_t is the return

**Action Value Function Q^π(s,a):**
- Expected cumulative reward from state s, action a following policy π
- Q^π(s,a) = E[G_t | S_t = s, A_t = a]

### 3.2 Bellman Equations
Recursive relationships for value functions.

**State Value Bellman Equation:**
V^π(s) = Σ_a π(a|s) Σ_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV^π(s')]

**Action Value Bellman Equation:**
Q^π(s,a) = Σ_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γΣ_{a'} π(a'|s')Q^π(s',a')]

### 3.3 Q-Learning

   - Update Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

**Key Features:**
- **Off-policy**: Can learn about optimal policy while following different policy
- **Temporal Difference**: Updates based on difference between estimates
- **Exploration**: Need to explore to learn optimal policy

### 3.4 SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
On-policy algorithm that learns action-value function.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize Q(s,a) arbitrarily
2. For each episode:
   - Choose action using policy derived from Q
   - Take action, observe reward and next state
   - Choose next action using policy derived from Q
   - Update Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[r + γ Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

**Key Features:**
- **On-policy**: Learns about policy being followed
- **Conservative**: More cautious than Q-learning
